/**
 * API Route - Run Assistant Image
 * 
 * This API route is crafted to generate an image with the OpenAI API. 
 * The route is responsible for receiving the assistant ID and thread ID, 
 * which are crucial for identifying the specific assistant and conversation thread to interact with. 
 * Upon receiving these IDs, the route invokes the OpenAI API to generate a prompt for
 * image generation. Then, the prompt pass to the image generation endpoint
 * and return the image back to the assistantâ€™s run. 
 * Path: /api/runAssistantImage

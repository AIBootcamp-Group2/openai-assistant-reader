# BookPal
OpenAI assistant chat-bot that helps you understand and ilustrate stories.

BookPal is an AI reader app that allows you to interact with the book of your choice, providing an immersive experience with the story or theme of the book. BookPal generates an OpenAI Assistant based on the book uploaded by the user in PDF or .txt format. Then, you can chat with the assistant about the book and answer any questions related to the book. For example, the assistant can provide an analysis of the characters, a description of the setting, a critique of the literary style, etc.

In addition, the BookPal AI assistant generates images based on your prompts or a suggested description from the assistant, such as images of the characters or a particular book scene. This image generator feature will provide you with on-demand and customized illustrations. BookPal will make reading a book a more enjoyable and deeply engaging experience.
